# `scheme-rs` standard libraries

Besides the R6RS standard libraries, `scheme-rs` provides its own set of 
standard libraries that form a unique language not necessarily compatible with
the Scheme standard. Those libraries are detailed here.

!!! warning
    The `scheme-rs` standard libraries are a work in progress, and you are 
    encouraged to use the R6RS standard libraries for the time being, although 
    there are some procedures that are only available through these libraries.
